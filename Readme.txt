Insertion in tri-nary tree:
Suppose I added the following nodes to the tree in this order: 5, 4, 9, 5, 7, 2, 2.
The resulting tree would look like this:
 5
/ | \
4 5 9
/     /
2   7
|
2

Deletion in tri-nary tree:
Delete operation can be in 2 ways. In both cases, we are given a value and we can delete only one node with that particular value or delete all occurrences of nodes with that value. For this implementation, let us consider the deletion of all occurrences of a value.
